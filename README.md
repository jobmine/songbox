# Songwriting web app
A DWD Project

A simple way to write song ideas in and organise them (notes+audio snippets).
With future possibilities (after the final submission, if ever) to suggest matches between unfinished song elements.

Some existing solutions are:
- https://songcraft.io/ - an amazing songwriting tool with different functionalities;  
- generic note-taking apps across platforms (like Evernote) - a somewhat awkward flow for the specific task of embedding audio snippets;
- well, pen and paper - works great for lyrics, but hard to notate music for songwriters without knowledge of notation; sometimes can be too disorganized;
A quick search across online forums shows there might be an actual demand for something like this.

Aim for:
- simplicity (&usability);
- limited features;
- focus different from what existing tools do; (tagging&recommendations)

Features:
- writing lyrics (text)
[- a separate line above to mark down chords alongside]
- embed audio snippets (directly within text body)
- add tags or blocks for structure - Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.
- add tags for style/instrument/mood (this would make it easier to deal with the bunches of standalone song pieces*)

Should be mobile-responsive ( with the ability to record directly from a mobile device).

*outside of the scope of the current project - but this gives the option for users to receive suggestions about what song parts might fit together. Better than scouring hundreds of little song snippets called "Untitled" or "aarghftpf123" ^^
